def levenshtein(s1, s2, weights=(1,1,1), max=None):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions
    required to change one sequence into the other according to Levenshtein with custom
    costs for insertion, deletion and substitution

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1 : str
        First string to compare
    s2 : str
        Second string to compare
    weights : Tuple[int, int, int] or None, optional
        The weights for the three operations in the form
        (insertion, deletion, substitution). Default is (1, 1, 1),
        which gives all three operations a weight of 1.
    max : int or None, optional
        Maximum Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2, that is
        considered as a result. If the distance is bigger than max,
        -1 is returned instead. Default is None, which deactivates
        this behaviour.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : int
        levenshtein distance between s1 and s2

    Notes
    -----
    Depending on the input parameters different optimized implementation are used
    to improve the performance.

    Insertion = Deletion = Substitution:
      This is known as uniform Levenshtein distance and is the distance most commonly
      referred to as Levenshtein distance. The following implementation is used
      with a worst-case performance of ``O([N/64]M)``.

      - if max is 0 the similarity can be calculated using a direct comparision,
        since no difference between the strings is allowed.  The time complexity of
        this algorithm is ``O(N)``.

      - A common prefix/suffix of the two compared strings does not affect
        the Levenshtein distance, so the affix is removed before calculating the
        similarity.

      - If max is ≤ 3 the mbleven algorithm is used. This algorithm
        checks all possible edit operations that are possible under
        the threshold `max`. The time complexity of this algorithm is ``O(N)``.

      - If the length of the shorter string is ≤ 64 after removing the common affix
        Hyyrös' algorithm is used, which calculates the Levenshtein distance in
        parallel. The algorithm is described by [1]_. The time complexity of this
        algorithm is ``O(N)``.

      - If the length of the shorter string is ≥ 64 after removing the common affix
        a blockwise implementation of Myers' algorithm is used, which calculates
        the Levenshtein distance in parallel (64 characters at a time).
        The algorithm is described by [3]_. The time complexity of this
        algorithm is ``O([N/64]M)``.

    The following image shows a benchmark of the Levenshtein distance in multiple
    Python libraries. All of them are implemented either in C/C++ or Cython.
    The graph shows, that python-Levenshtein is the only library with a time
    complexity of ``O(NM)``, while all other libraries have a time complexity of
    ``O([N/64]M)``. Especially for long strings RapidFuzz is a lot faster than
    all the other tested libraries.

    Insertion = Deletion, Substitution >= Insertion + Deletion:
      Since every Substitution can be performed as Insertion + Deletion, this variant
      of the Levenshtein distance only uses Insertions and Deletions. Therefore this
      variant is often referred to as InDel-Distance.  The following implementation
      is used with a worst-case performance of ``O([N/64]M)``.

      - if max is 0 the similarity can be calculated using a direct comparision,
        since no difference between the strings is allowed.  The time complexity of
        this algorithm is ``O(N)``.

      - if max is 1 and the two strings have a similar length, the similarity can be
        calculated using a direct comparision aswell, since a substitution would cause
        a edit distance higher than max. The time complexity of this algorithm
        is ``O(N)``.

      - A common prefix/suffix of the two compared strings does not affect
        the Levenshtein distance, so the affix is removed before calculating the
        similarity.

      - If max is ≤ 4 the mbleven algorithm is used. This algorithm
        checks all possible edit operations that are possible under
        the threshold `max`. As a difference to the normal Levenshtein distance this
        algorithm can even be used up to a threshold of 4 here, since the higher weight
        of substitutions decreases the amount of possible edit operations.
        The time complexity of this algorithm is ``O(N)``.

      - If the length of the shorter string is ≤ 64 after removing the common affix
        the BitPAl algorithm is used, which calculates the Levenshtein distance in
        parallel. The algorithm is described by [4]_ and is extended with support
        for UTF32 in this implementation. The time complexity of this
        algorithm is ``O(N)``.

      - If the length of the shorter string is ≥ 64 after removing the common affix
        a blockwise implementation of the BitPAl algorithm is used, which calculates
        the Levenshtein distance in parallel (64 characters at a time).
        The algorithm is described by [4]_. The time complexity of this
        algorithm is ``O([N/64]M)``.

    The following image shows a benchmark of the InDel distance in RapidFuzz
    and python-Levenshtein. Similar to the normal Levenshtein distance
    python-Levenshtein uses a implementation with a time complexity of ``O(NM)``,
    while RapidFuzz has a time complexity of ``O([N/64]M)``.

    Other weights:
      The implementation for other weights is based on Wagner-Fischer.
      It has a performance of ``O(N * M)`` and has a memory usage of ``O(N)``.
      Further details can be found in [2]_.
